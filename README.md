# AuroImage

### Project Overview

In partnering with Aurolabs, a not for profit company within Aravind Eye Care System, we aim to make an impact in low resource communities in India. The ultimate mission is to develop a low-vision (LV) wearable assistive device that is suitable for the Indian market. This requires a device that is low cost yet high quality, consisting of features found in existing LV global products like OrCam or Envision, augmented with internet connection independence, low lag time, and Indian specific language and currency identification. The precursor to such a device is relevant data, i.e. image data specific to Indian culture that LV patients would likely encounter in their daily activities. The AuroImage (AI) app aims to enable local (to India) field workers in capturing and labelling images in a task oriented fashion. These labelled images are uploaded to a remote server where researchers can utilize the companion website to further refine the data extraction. This companion website also enables a manager to create field workers, allocate tasks to field workers, and ultimately download the mass amount of data for computer vision training.
